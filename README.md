# firebase-essentials
<b>Greetings, fellow developers! I'll be walking you through Firebase, starting with the basics and gradually moving towards more advanced concepts. But before we begin, please ensure that you have set up your own `configurations` and have a Firebase `account`</b>

<b>`Note:` I prioritized basic Firebase functionalities over UI and kept it responsive</b>

# Project Overview
<b>The following aspects are the primary focus of the project:</b>
<ol>
<b>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Firestore Database</li>
<li>Storage</li>
</b>
</ol>

# Project Prerequisites
<ol>
<b>
<li>React.js</li>
<li>Materialize for components</li>
<li>Bootstrap for responsiveness</li>
</b>
</ol>

# Install Dependencies
<b>`Front-end: cd client --> npm install`</b> <br><br>
<b>`â€¢ The project won't function correctly unless you use your own configurations`</b>
